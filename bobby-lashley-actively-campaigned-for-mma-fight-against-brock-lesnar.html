He said <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">he had always believed the match with Lesnar would happen</a> but anticipated the bout to take place in an MMA ring than a WWE arena.</p><p>Lashley revealed he actively campaigned for a match against Brock Lesnar at a time when both were going strong in MMA organizations Bellator and Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC).</p><p>“I thought it was going to happen there (in MMA). But I was with (Scott) Coker, and he was with Dana (White). Coker is always open to doing whatever. We kind of briefly talked about it a few times. He was open for it if there was ever an opportunity for it to happen.”</p><p>Lashley holds a commendable record in MMA with 15 wins and two losses. Lesnar, on the other hand, became UFC’s top attraction during a short yet impactful stint that also saw him capture the promotion’s heavyweight title.</p><p>The stars finally aligned and the two are now set to face each other at the Royal Rumble PPV this Sunday (Jan. 29). Will the almighty slay the beast or will it be the other way round, time will tell.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p><strong>What’s your take on this story?
