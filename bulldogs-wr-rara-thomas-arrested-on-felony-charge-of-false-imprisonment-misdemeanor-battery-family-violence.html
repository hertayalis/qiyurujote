He announced his transfer to Georgia in December and was expected to be a key member of the Bulldogs’ offense after receiver Kearis Jackson declared for the NFL draft and receiver Adonai Adonai Mitchell entered the transfer portal.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sportszion.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/GettyImages-1424735681.jpg alt width=795 height=417 sizes="(max-width: 795px) 100vw, 795px" data-pagespeed-url-hash=2690620804 onload=pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this) style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Mitchell, who later committed to Texas, missed much of the 2022 season with a high ankle sprain but returned in time to make the game-winning, 10-yard touchdown catch against Ohio State in the College Football Playoff semifinal. He added a 22-yard touchdown catch against TCU in the national title game.</p><p>Thomas’s arrest is a major setback for Georgia, and the consequences it may have are yet to be seen. With the Georgia Athletic Department having high standards for their student-athletes, they may take this into account and take necessary disciplinary action. Thomas had been expected to be a vital part of the Bulldogs’ offense, but the team will now have to find a way to carry on without him.</p><p>Despite the arrest of Thomas, the Georgia Bulldogs’ offensive lineup is still looking strong. Thomas’ transfer in December had added to their already impressive offensive arsenal, making them a formidable team going into the 2022 season.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLzOq6usspmku2%2BvzqZmm62cobGws9Jmrqtlopa%2FonnToaammaNirrO%2BxKyrnpxdpLtussSlpqexXZi1or7GnmSonl2brq2%2FxGagpqiinsCwusyepa1lnZ7ApbHMnpinp6Jir6LA056psmWWlrqquNhmraKnnJq7pLGO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
