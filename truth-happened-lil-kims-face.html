One person who wasn't buying this was <a href=#>Wendy Williams</a>, who called the <a href=#>under-fire rapper</a> out on her talk show. "Do you want to talk about Lil Kim and that face of hers?" Williams <a href=#>asked</a> her audience. "Lil Kim has been making headlines because of her dramatic new look. It's not necessarily a new look, it's been over the course of maybe the last decade, she's been getting stuff&nbsp;— it looks like&nbsp;— done, done, filled, filled, filled. It's so tight now, Kim, it looks like a pin would just pop you."</p><p>The studio audience laughed along as Williams tore into Lil Kim, insulting her "big chin piece" and saying that she needed to "blame [her] plastic surgeon" rather than the blogs. "Kim, in my mind I know your goal was always to look like La Toya Jackson&nbsp;— you've out-La Toya'd La Toya in your new look," Williams added. She decided to tweet the segment and she even tagged Lil Kim in it to make sure she saw it, which probably wasn't the smartest move. Lil Kim <a href=#>fired back</a>, and she didn't pull any punches&nbsp;— the rapper claimed that her former beau Biggie Smalls ghosted Williams after a one night stand. "He didn't want nothing to do with yo a** after that," she tweeted.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma2hmaoRwwNGuq6FlmJa9sbHNnptmpJmheqy1zKxkn5mTmnw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
