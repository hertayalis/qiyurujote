She is still working out in the ring and learning as well. We were told that the 32-year-old wrestler “is still taking major time working in-ring.” Additionally, we were told that, “She’s great, but still green in this style.”</p><p>Vanessa Borne isn’t the only Superstar that WWE called up from NXT only to make them sit around and wait forever. As of this writing, it seems that Borne has sat motionless for the longest out of everyone in her situation.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>February 13, 2021 9:13 am</p><span class=author-name>H Jenkins</span> <span></span><p>I love pro wrestling and hate BS.
