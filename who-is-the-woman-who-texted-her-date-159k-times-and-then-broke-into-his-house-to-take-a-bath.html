But that’s not what happened.”</p><h2 id=h-why-did-jacqueline-ades-break-into-the-man-s-home-and-take-a-bath data-injectable=false>Why did Jacqueline Ades break into the man’s home and take a bath?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=536 data-injectable=true>Via AZFamily/YouTube</figure><p data-characters=398 data-current-count=398 data-injectable=false>Ades was arrested when she broke into the man’s home, and security cameras caught her taking a bath in his house. A large butcher’s knife was reportedly found on the seat of her car (which Ades disputed in the press). At the time, she was charged with criminal trespassing and ultimately released, but she continued to text the man, threatening to kill him and making Hitler references.</p><p data-characters=484 data-current-count=882 data-injectable=true>Not long after, Ades showed up at the man’s office claiming to be his wife (he was out of the country). Days later, she was arrested for stalking and harassment, among other charges. She pleaded not guilty. When asked what happened between her and the man and if she’d ever hurt him, Ades said, “No! Oh, my God, I love him so much. I just want to love him so much, that’s it. And if he doesn’t like it, I’ll go home [to Florida] and I’ll love my ex-boyfriend.”</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Why were Ades’ charges dropped?</h2><p data-characters=299 data-current-count=299 data-injectable=false>About two years after her arrest, Ades’ charges were dropped for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">mental health reasons</a>. At that time, Ades spent up to two weeks in an Arizona behavioral health facility before returning to Florida, where she continued to receive treatment. She was barred from contacting the man in the case.</p><p data-characters=410 data-current-count=709 data-injectable=false>As of 2024, there was some uncertainty about Ades’ whereabouts and whether she may have died in 2021. At the time of this writing, no news reports confirmed Ades’ death, but a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Find a Grave</a> page did list someone named Jaqueline Ades as having died in 2021 in Florida at around 35 years old. Pictures on the post appear to be the same Jaqueline Ades in the Arizona case. No cause of death was given.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekp8KmecKroKadX6y1sHnIrGStoJVixLC5wKdksKCfYsGmxNOem2aglad6pa3TnmRqbWmgerW1zJ6qZpmemXq1tMSnZJuqn6CybrXNraZmoJmoeqm71KycZqyfYsGit8RmmGaakam1cA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
