She included the caption, "If he doesn't have a problem with it why should anyone else?" The actor also took to <a href=#>Instagram Stories</a> (via <a href=#>People</a>) to share a comment that said, "I am getting tired of seeing 'bi' celebrities consistently advocate for it only to end up conventionally married to men with multiple children, living out the so-called white-picket-fence life." Paquin added, "Ah yes ... the 'you aren't queer enough' BS."</p><p dir=ltr>This isn't the first time Paquin has discussed her bisexuality. In 2010, she came out in the <a href=#>Give a Damn campaign</a>, which featured celebrities pushing for equality. "I'm Anna Paquin. I'm <a href=#>bisexual, and I give a damn</a>," she said at the time. And in June 2014, she <a href=#>tweeted</a> in support of gay marriage, writing, "Proud to be a happily married bisexual mother. Marriage is about love not gender."</p><p dir=ltr>The also actor got candid with Zooey magazine (via People) in 2012, saying, "If you're going to talk about some cause in a way that's meaningful, you should identify why it means something to you," she said. "For a bisexual, it's not about gender. That's not the deciding factor for who they're attracted to." Paquin has no problem <a href=#>calling out "bigots,"</a> and she'll keep dispelling myths about bisexuality as long as trolls comment on her posts.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbWllZYVxe9OhnGaqlZa5br7Emqqopl2Wu6%2BtjKmYqq2Zo3qqv4ydnJ%2Bdnpm2r7OMoZyrZZ2Wv7O1wKCcaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
