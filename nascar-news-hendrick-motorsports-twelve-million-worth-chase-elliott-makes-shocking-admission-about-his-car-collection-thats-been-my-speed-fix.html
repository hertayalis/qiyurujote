However, many drivers do not feel that to be enough. Owing to their love of speed, some of them crave adrenaline even when they are off the track. And that’s why drivers like <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Dale Earnhardt Jr</a>, Kyle Busch, Jimmie Johnson, and <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Joey Logano</a> among others, have the coolest and the rarest cars in their collections.</p><p>However, NASCAR’s most popular driver, Chase Elliott, might not be impressed by any of it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/GettyImages-1244337661.jpg><p>In his recent appearance on the Pat McAfee show, <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Chase Elliott</a> was asked to share the details of his car collection. Citing how he himself loves the speed, the show’s co-host encouraged Elliott to talk about what he drives on a day-to-day basis. But little did he know that Elliott would have such a surprising answer to it.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9><strong>Chase Elliott has a shocking response about his car collection</strong></h2><p>As soon as the host asked Elliott where he finds his speed off the track, Elliott said, “That’s a great question. And this is not probably the norm… I think there are some guys that collect cars, I’ve just never been a car collector.”</p><p>“I don’t really have a collection of cars. The driving aspect and the racing has been my fix. That’s been my speed fix forever. I have never really needed anything else.”</p><p>This was shocking, as many expected the driver to have a huge car collection, especially since the $12 million worth (as per Celebrity Net Worth) driver comes from a racing background. Surprised by his answer, show’s host Pat McAfee immediately exclaimed, “So you drive a minivan out there? Chase, you’re driving a minivan out there?”</p><p>And continuing his streak of unexpected answers, Elliott replied with a smile, “Yeah! If Chevrolet sold a nice minivan, I’d consider it.”</p><a href=# class="jsx-9bcc7694f95d3e8b transparent-card"><img id="img-tag-nascar-news-hendrick-motorsports-watch-chase-elliotts-live-reaction-after-he-is-mocked-with-nepotism-preferential-treatment-tag?utm_campaign=internal_links&utm_medium=dive_deeper&utm_source=website-embed-image" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/imago1015312844h.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="jsx-9bcc7694f95d3e8b card-content">Watch: Chase Elliott’s Live Reaction After He Is Mocked With Nepotism & “Preferential Treatment” Tag</p></a><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9><strong>Chase Elliott’s return to the tracks</strong></h2><p>Earlier in 2023, Chase Elliott fractured his tibia in a snowboarding accident. Having to undergo surgery for the same, the <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Hendrick Motorsports</a> driver missed six races. However, now, all Elliott fans can finally breathe a sigh of relief. Because as per the recent reports by Fox Sports, Elliott is all set to return to the tracks at the upcoming <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Martinsville</a> race.</p><p>In a recent press release, HMS owner Rick Hendrick stated, “We’re looking forward to having Chase back in his race car to pick up where he left off. Since the injury, he’s worked extremely hard and focused all his time and energy on returning to the No. 9 team.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/imago1015312844h.jpg><p>“Throughout the last six weeks, he’s stayed fully engaged with everything we’re doing, and we know he’s chomping at the bit to get on the racetrack and compete for wins.”</p><p>While Elliott was recovering from his injury, JR Motorsports driver Josh Berry substituted for him in the #9. Whereas, road-racing champion Jordan Taylor drove the #9 charter during the <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Circuits of The Americas</a> race.</p><p><span><strong>WATCH THIS STORY:</strong> <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Recent Chase Elliott Injury Update Leads Fans to Anticipate the Hendrick Motorsports Star’s Return at Legendary NASCAR Race</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pr%2FSnqWtoZGhubq%2Fz6ipratemLyue82aqpyZomK7psPSZp%2BeppSntqS3jKamraeiqL2wvtOsZK2vlaHDpnnMoqOloZ%2Bjeri70a2fZpuYlsCmecSlo6KnpKl6rq3Knqpmq5iksKy1zaBkmpydnsC0tc6nZJqan6rBbrTIrGScmaJisLC4y56araGfo3q1tMCtqmaalZq7brnYZqqpnZWZeqe112g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
