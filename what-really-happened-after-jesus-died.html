Specifically, the writers both mention "the curtain of the temple" being torn in two, "from top to bottom." According to the Christian question-and-answer column <a href=#>Got Questions</a>, the writers are referring to a veil of sorts that hung in the temple, physically and figuratively separating the room where God's very presence was said to linger from an outer chamber. The garment was said to be as thick as a man's hand (about 4 inches). Therefore, the veil being torn in two on Jesus' death was something of a metaphor for the barrier between God and man having been destroyed, the column notes.</p><p>Matthew also adds that Jesus' death was followed by an earthquake so powerful that rocks split, after which tombs opened, and the dead walked out, alive and well. <a href=#>Luke</a> notes that the crowd wailed and grieved before dispersing, while <a href=#>John</a> notes that the soldiers were set to break Jesus' legs to hasten his death but did not do so. Instead, a soldier pierced Jesus' side with a spear, and blood and water flowed out.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCClmtra29frLWiwIyrnJqknK56qa3PqZynnZRirqfAxKtko52jqsBusMiem2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
