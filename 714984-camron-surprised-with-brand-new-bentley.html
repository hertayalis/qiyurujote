The "Hey Ma" rapper has been living the luxury life for more than two decades due to his <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">longtime musical success,</a> however, he was surprised with a gift that left him astonished. On Monday, September 18, his longtime friend and business partner, Suga Dugga, gave him an unexpected gift: a brand-new Bentley. A video shared on Instagram captured the moment when the car was discreetly driven off a trailer right in front of Cam's residence.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The friend, the mastermind behind this surprise, then went to fetch Cam from inside his house. He was busy on a phone call, completely unaware of the delivery. Although it took a bit of convincing, his friend managed to bring the hesitant Cam to step outside his house to witness Suga's gift, which left him in disbelief. “Get the f**k outta here,” the rapper reacted while walking up to the car.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-cam-ron-was-completely-unaware-of-the-surprise>Cam'ron Was Completely Unaware Of The Surprise</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">After that, Cam dialed up his business partner to double-check if the Bentley was, in fact, meant for him. He made a joke asking if it was stolen or not. "This s**t ain’t stolen is it?" he asked with a smirk on his face. "Thank you, man. Yo, I really appreciate this s**t, man. Now, if I get pulled over and go to jail or some shit, you already know, n***a." Cam'ron shared the video of the surprise on his personal Instagram account, along with a heartfelt message expressing his gratitude to Suga Dugga.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">“I’ve been so busy doing @itiswhatitis_talk that I haven’t had time to thank the people/Customers that purchase @pinkhorsepower,” he wrote. “2 weeks ago we reached 1 million sales and it’s been a great ride thank you guys so much!!” He continued: “With that being said my brother @sugadugga_ent said ima get you something. He’s my partner in the biz, and he was overwhelmed of this accomplishment that we achieved. I didn’t know he was gonna get me this. Suge thank you so much. "All brothers fight but you the only one that never shared our arguments with anyone. went public etc. and I truly appreciate that," he continued. "Im happy to see the young man you’ve become. Now let’s sell 5mill Nx year. Love u bro. And thx @thebosslrsm for executing the surprise."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdnZoF6hJNmmpqloqS7br%2FUq6eroaOasW7DyK2fZpqilrulec2ermaalaPBrbHY</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
