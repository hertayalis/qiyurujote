Not once did he ever explain who his so-called "enemies" were and unfortunately, most of his victims were probably too afraid to ask him to elaborate. While this line may have worked in his relationships, it probably wouldn't be a reasonable thing for one to tell their boss.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>After the women found out he was a fraud and stopped sending him money, Leviev endured a brief period of financial struggle. He sent the photo on the right to his girlfriend, Ayleen, and asked her to send him some money.
