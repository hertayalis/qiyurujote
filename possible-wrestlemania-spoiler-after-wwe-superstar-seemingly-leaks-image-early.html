Her best friend Bayley is the champion and she will have Lacey Evans, Tamina, and Naomi to deal with as well.</p><p>This photo was quickly deleted, but it was sent in to us by one of our awesome readers. This is certainly interesting timing to be posting a photo and then deleting it. Banks also knows how the game is played and we’re sure Bayley would let her borrow the belt for a minute so she can play a little pre-WrestleMania prank on the internet.</p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure><figure class=wp-block-image></figure><span class=author-name>Felix Upton</span> <span></span><p>Felix Upton is a seasoned writer with over 30 years of experience.
