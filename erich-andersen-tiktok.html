In his role, Erich was charged with negotiating with the American government in the hopes of proving to the Americans that TikTok's data from American users was walled off from the Chinese government. Investigative reporting has suggested that much of that data was meant to mask more than reveal the truth.</p><p>Given that a bill has now made its way to the Senate which is meant to ban TikTok in the US or force the US business to be <a href=#>sold to another company</a>, it seems like Erich's efforts to negotiate with the US government were not a success. It would make sense, then, if the company was ready to part ways with him, but TikTok's parent company Bytedance has thus far denied rumors that that's its intention.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Who is Erich Andersen?</h2><p>Erich has served as Bytedance's global general counsel for four years. Before that, he worked at Microsoft for more than 20 years in various corporate attorney roles. Although he was given the lofty responsibility of trying to save TikTok from a ban, Erich seems to be a pretty standard corporate lawyer who has risen through the ranks to become someone who is entrusted with immense power and responsibility.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>NEWS</p><p>TikTok is preparing to remove a key executive responsible for convincing the US government that the company was doing enough to stave off national security concerns about its connections to China.</p><p>Erich Andersen, the US-based general counsel for TikTok and its Chinese‚Ä¶ <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/TgoYyvpNqu</a></p>‚Äî Yashar Ali üêò (@yashar) <a href=#>April 21, 2024</a> <span>Source: Twitter/@yashar</span></figure><p>Whether Erich was actually fired by Bytedance or not, it's pretty clear that their efforts to convince influential government officials that the ban was unnecessary have failed.</p><p>If the ban goes through, TikTok <a href=#>will have roughly six months</a> to find an American company that could purchase it to keep it from shutting down in the US.</p><p>That could be a tall task in and of itself given TikTok's multi-billion dollar valuation, and the fact that many of the companies who might consider buying it are concerned about creating a monopoly that would leave them open to lawsuits.</p><p style=text-align:left>If TikTok doesn't get purchased, though, the company will cease operating in the US, and the app will become unavailable in all US-based app stores. Many TikTok users live in fear of this possibility.
