Earlier in his history, the cannibalism hadn't really ramped up yet, however, so several of his murders from the 1980s ended up as trophies the police would eventually find when he was caught.</p><p>Speaking of his capture, it's an oddly anti-climactic one. Police found a man named Tracy Edwards wandering the street with handcuffs around one wrist, according to <a href=#>Biography</a>. Edwards told them about a strange man who drugged and restrained him, but he had managed to escape. Edwards told them exactly where Dahmer lived, and upon investigating his apartment, found heads in his refrigerator and freezer, among various other body parts. What really did him in, though, were the extremely graphic Polaroid photos he had taken of himself killing and dismembering people. Turns out, that's really good evidence in court. Dahmer murdered about 17 young men then was murdered himself in prison in 1994.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCAkmpubWpfqbWmecyoqq1llJa7qLHRqKysZaOav6qty2aioqScmr%2B0ec6fZK2glWJ%2BeoSPrGY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
