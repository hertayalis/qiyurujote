Last week, I spent a whirlwind 6 days in the Rhone Valley. I loved meeting many of the winemakers, hearing their stories, walking through the vineyards, and driving to the tops of (so many) peaks. There was so much to see in addition to the wine – olive trees, lavender, cherry trees, apricot trees, wild vegetables, and herbs growing everywhere. It’s a heavenly place to visit if you love fruit, vegetables, and wines as much as I do."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It’s such a charming city that&nbsp;I had fun just wandering the streets. I walked through&nbsp;the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Les Halles d’ Avignon</a> covered market before heading to brunch at <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">L’ Amuse-Bouche</a>, a cute cafe that serves their food on shareable boards. I started my trip with croissants & chocolate mousse.</p><p class=p1>In the afternoon I took a tour of the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Palais des Papes.</a>&nbsp;I recommend getting the helpful audio guide, which is available in a few different languages.</p><p><span class=pibfi_pinterest><span class=xc_pin onclick='pin_this(event,"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.loveandlemons.com/guide-rhone-valley/&media=https://www.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/IMG_8459.jpg&description=My+Guide+to+the+Rhone+Valley+%26%238211%3B+Part+I")'></span></span><span class=pibfi_pinterest><span class=xc_pin onclick='pin_this(event,"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.loveandlemons.com/guide-rhone-valley/&media=https://www.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/4-1.jpg&description=My+Guide+to+the+Rhone+Valley+%26%238211%3B+Part+I")'></span></span></p><p>In the evening, my guide drove me to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Domaine des Peyre</a> in Luberon. It’s a gorgeous vineyard with 5 newly renovated apartment-style rooms and a beautiful infinity pool. I was surrounded by cherry trees, almond trees, and olive trees. My room had a view of the vines – it was basically heaven. We tasted the wines before the winemaker Patricia took me to her home for dinner where they served ratatouille – which I love – and apricot cheesecake with chocolate. I was pinching myself the entire time.</p><p><span class=pibfi_pinterest><span class=xc_pin onclick='pin_this(event,"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.loveandlemons.com/guide-rhone-valley/&media=https://www.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/IMG_8463-1.jpg&description=My+Guide+to+the+Rhone+Valley+%26%238211%3B+Part+I")'></span></span><span class=pibfi_pinterest><span class=xc_pin onclick='pin_this(event,"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.loveandlemons.com/guide-rhone-valley/&media=https://www.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/IMG_9705.jpg&description=My+Guide+to+the+Rhone+Valley+%26%238211%3B+Part+I")'></span></span></p><p class=p1><b>Day 2:</b></p><p class=p1>We visited <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Domaine de la Citadelle</a> in Menerbes. The winemaker took us through his corkscrew museum (with over 1200 unique types of corkscrews!) After that, we visited his gardens (hike up a little bit and the view is amazing) and tasted the wines.</p><p class=p1>I then went&nbsp;to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Cafe Fleurs</a> for lunch. It’s a lovely spot in the Isle sir la Sorge. Their menu changes seasonally – everything was delicious, especially the gazpacho with savory tomato sorbet. I skipped dessert but regretted it later when I took a photo of my guide Clemance’s cake (pictured above) with lemon curd and strawberries. After lunch, we walked around the town and visited some of the many antique stores.</p><p class=p1><span class=pibfi_pinterest><span class=xc_pin onclick='pin_this(event,"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.loveandlemons.com/guide-rhone-valley/&media=https://www.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC02895.jpg&description=My+Guide+to+the+Rhone+Valley+%26%238211%3B+Part+I")'></span></span></p><p class=p1>Later in the afternoon, we went to Vacqueyras to the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Rhonea Winemakers club of Beames, Venise and Vacqueras</a> wines. You can take a tour in a 4×4 of the nearby villages and vineyards (about 2 hours total). Because I’m a wimp, skipped that and drove straight to the top of Beaumes de Venise to taste the wines on top of the mountain.</p><p class=p1><span class=pibfi_pinterest><span class=xc_pin onclick='pin_this(event,"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.loveandlemons.com/guide-rhone-valley/&media=https://www.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/IMG_8708.jpg&description=My+Guide+to+the+Rhone+Valley+%26%238211%3B+Part+I")'></span></span><span class=pibfi_pinterest><span class=xc_pin onclick='pin_this(event,"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.loveandlemons.com/guide-rhone-valley/&media=https://www.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC02903.jpg&description=My+Guide+to+the+Rhone+Valley+%26%238211%3B+Part+I")'></span></span></p><p class=p1><b>Day 3:</b></p><p class=p1>After spending the night in <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Vaison la Romaine</a>, I woke up and visited the big street market that takes place every Tuesday morning during the summer. Whenever I travel, visiting markets is one of my FAVORITE things to do and this one didn’t disappoint. I took pictures of pretty vegetables and bought a few olive wood cutting boards.</p><p><span class=pibfi_pinterest><span class=xc_pin onclick='pin_this(event,"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.loveandlemons.com/guide-rhone-valley/&media=https://www.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC02934-2.jpg&description=My+Guide+to+the+Rhone+Valley+%26%238211%3B+Part+I")'></span></span><span class=pibfi_pinterest><span class=xc_pin onclick='pin_this(event,"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.loveandlemons.com/guide-rhone-valley/&media=https://www.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC02944.jpg&description=My+Guide+to+the+Rhone+Valley+%26%238211%3B+Part+I")'></span></span></p><p class=p1>We then&nbsp;drove to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Domaine Rozel </a>(one of my favorites).&nbsp;The family has been making wines for 22 generations! The winemaker Matthieu walked us through the vineyard showing us the farmhouse where he grew up as well as the lavender field, olive trees, wild asparagus, wild fennel, and wild honeysuckle. We were supposed cover this ground on Segways – but alas, I’m still a wimp, so we walked. Afterward we tasted wines – I especially loved their rose.</p><p class=p1>We had lunch at a cute cafe in the village of Valaurie. (I can’t remember the name, but it was the only cafe you see see walking up to the village – pictured below).</p><p class=p1><span class=pibfi_pinterest><span class=xc_pin onclick='pin_this(event,"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.loveandlemons.com/guide-rhone-valley/&media=https://www.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/IMG_9708.jpg&description=My+Guide+to+the+Rhone+Valley+%26%238211%3B+Part+I")'></span></span></p><p class=p1>After lunch, we had a tour of <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Suze la Rousse</a>, a medieval chateaux which is now a wine museum and also a wine university. The photo below is the view from the castle.&nbsp;Driving in this area was one of my favorite parts of the trip because there are lavender fields everywhere.</p><p class=p1><span class=pibfi_pinterest><span class=xc_pin onclick='pin_this(event,"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.loveandlemons.com/guide-rhone-valley/&media=https://www.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/IMG_8633-2.jpg&description=My+Guide+to+the+Rhone+Valley+%26%238211%3B+Part+I")'></span></span></p><p class=p1>Later that night, we drove further north to Tournon-sur-Rhône and stayed at <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Hotel de la Villeon</a> which I LOVED. It’s a very very nice boutique hotel in an 18th century building that was recently renovated. My room had a view of a castle, and we had dinner outside in the garden. They had a lovely breakfast in the morning too.</p><p><span class=pibfi_pinterest><span class=xc_pin onclick='pin_this(event,"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.loveandlemons.com/guide-rhone-valley/&media=https://www.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/IMG_9417.jpg&description=My+Guide+to+the+Rhone+Valley+%26%238211%3B+Part+I")'></span></span></p><p>Stay tuned for more!</p><p>Special thanks to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Atout France</a> & <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Air France </a>for sending me & to my new friends at <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Inter Rhone</a> for taking me around!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbvVnpinnJyaurC60meaqKVfnMKqsMRmqaGnnpp6t63LpZyyZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
