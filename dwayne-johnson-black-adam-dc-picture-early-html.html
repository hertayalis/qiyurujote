After months of anticipation and speculation, we are finally inching towards the release of the Dwayne Johnson starrer Black Adam. The character is an antihero from Kahndaq and is destined to become the archenemy of the superhero Shazam, if the story follows the expected path."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The character is an <a href=#>antihero</a> from Kahndaq and is destined to become the archenemy of the superhero Shazam, if the story follows the expected path. While the shooting of the film wrapped up back in the summer of 2021, Johnson is currently engrossed in the post-production of the same. And to ensure that his fans don’t feel left out until the DC title’s release, the actor has shared a cool behind-the-scenes photo teasing the major VFX effects that will be employed in the superhero project.</p><p>Dwayne Johnson took to <a href=#>Instagram</a> to share the image presenting a glimpse of the hard work the VFX team is putting into the live-action adaption of Black Adam. Check out the post below:</p><p>In the picture, Dwayne Johnson is seen sitting surrounded by a rig of multiple technical pieces of equipment, which he calls “the egg,” and holding a particularly angry expression while even his tiniest movements are being captured. As explained by Johnson in the post, this alone took ten hours of sitting, and the actor was only allowed to move his eyes, head, and shoulders while channeling Black Adam via his expressions. Whoa! That sure sounds tough.</p><p>Dwayne Johnson also revealed that these particular sequences are for Black Adam’s early days as Teth Adam in his birthplace of Kahndaq. He also extended his gratitude to the film’s director, Jaume Collet Serra, and Black Adam’s VFX supervisor, the two-time Oscar-winning Bill Westenhofer. While Dwayne Johnson alone would have been enough to bring DC fans to the theaters for Black Adam, the film’s elite cast will also feature Aldis Hodge as Hawkman, Noah Centineo as Atom Smasher, Quintessa Swindell as Cyclone, Pierce Brosnan will be seen as Doctor Fate, and Sarah Shahi is set to play Adrianna Tomaz. Atom Smasher, Cyclone, Hawkman, and Doctor Fate will appear as part of the DC superhero team, <a href=#>Justice Society of America</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Uli Latukefu, Marwan Kenzari, Mohammed Amer, James Cusati-Moyer, and Bodhi Sabongui are also part of the cast, though their roles haven’t been officially announced yet. Based on a script by Adam Sztykiel, Rory Haines, and Sohrab Noshirvani, the DC film is directed by Jaume Collet- Serra, who also helmed Disney’s Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt starrer <a href=#>Jungle Cruise</a>. <a href=#>Black Adam</a> is set to debut in theaters this year on July 29.&nbsp;</p><p>Apart from appearing as the titular ant-hero in the upcoming DCEU film, Dwayne Johnson is also voicing Krypto, Superman’s dog in DC League of Super-Pets. Also, the actor recently starred in Netflix’s comedy-heist drama, Red Notice, opposite Ryan Reynolds and Gal Gadot. Even though the film was critically panned by critics, it has been <a href=#>breaking records</a> on the streamer. In fact, according to <a href=#>Giant Freakin Robot</a>’s exclusive report, Netflix is planning a potential future franchise and has already greenlit three sequels. While we can’t confirm whether the trio will be returning to reprise their roles, seeing that Red Notice ended with an open conclusion with the three master thieves embarking on their second heist, their presence in the next film is beyond question.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2icp5bGr7GMo6ahpqOku26uy5qapGWRma6uecOcZKmhk6nCs7GMnpirpKljtbW5yw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
