With its Zen-based hardware, AMD has been relatively good at staying around that official on-the-box value, even during turbo. In the last generation, AMD introduced a feature called PPT, or Package Power Tracking.</p><li>For 105 W processors, PPT is >142 W</li><li>For 65 W processors, PPT is >88 W</li><li>For 45 W processors, PPT is >60W</li><p>This allows the processor to raise its power limits, assuming it isn’t breaching thermal limits or current limits, and consequently raise the frequency. As a result, while we see 65 W on the box, the real world power consumption during most tasks is likely to be nearer 88 W, unless the current or thermal lines are crossed.</p><p>As a new element to our testing, we are recording power over a number of benchmarks in our suite, rather than just a simple peak power test.</p><h3>AMD Ryzen 3 3300X</h3><p>For the faster chip, we saw a peak power in both of our tests of around 80 W.</p><p align=center><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/15774/3300X%20Power%20yCruncher_575px.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>With yCruncher, which is somewhat of a periodic load, the power consumption dropped over time to nearer 75 W.</p><p align=center><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/15774/3300X%20Power%203DPM_575px.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>3DPM is more obvious with its idle steps between loads, being 10 seconds on then 10 seconds waiting. The power almost peaked at a similar amount here.</p><p>In both of these graphs, the package power when idle is around 16-17 W. I looked back through the data, and noticed that out of this power only 0.3 W was actually dedicated to cores, with the rest being towards the big IO die, the memory controllers, and the Infinity Fabric. That’s still pretty substantial for an idle load.</p><p>At low loads, the power per core was around 14 W, while at full load it was slightly less depending on the test. This is a bit away from the 20 W per core we get from the high end Zen 2 processors, but these only go to 4.3 GHz, not 4.7 GHz+. This is about in line with what we expect.</p><p>On our frequency ramp test, the Ryzen 3300X went from an idle state to peak power within 17 milliseconds, or approximately a frame at 60 Hz.</p><p><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/15774/3300X%20Frequency%20Ramp_575px.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>One of the new features with Ryzen 3000 is CPPC2 support, which AMD claims to reduce idle-to-turbo ramping from 30 milliseconds to 2 milliseconds. We’re seeing something in the middle of that, despite having all the updates applied. That being said, the jump up to the peak frequency (we measured 4350 MHz, +50 MHz over the turbo on the box) is effectively immediate with zero skew across a range of frequencies.</p><h3>AMD Ryzen 3 3100</h3><p>Given that the TDP number on the side of the box says 65 W as well, any reasonable user would assume that the power of this chip would be equal, right? Regular readers will know that this isn’t always the case.</p><p align=center><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/15774/3100%20Power%20yCruncher_575px.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>In our yCruncher test, because the turbo frequency is lower than the 3300X, it means the voltage can be lower, and thus power is lower. Our history of testing Zen 2 has shown that these cores get very efficient at lower frequencies, to the point where our processor doesn’t even break that 65 W threshold during yCruncher.</p><p align=center><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/15774/3100%20Power%203DPM_575px.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Similarly the 3DPM peaks are also lower, barely going to 55 W during an AVX2 workload.</p><p>On the frequency ramp side, we see another instance of a 16-17 ms transition.</p><p align=center><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/15774/3100%20Frequency%20Ramp_575px.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><h3>Summary</h3><p>For the peak power out of all of our testing, we saw the Ryzen 3 3300X hit a maximum of 80 W, and the Ryzen 3 3100 go to 62 W. When we compare that to the Core i7-7700K, at 91 W TDP / 95 W peak, combined with most of the results on the next few pages, AMD by comparison is more efficient.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZH52g5ZtZq2glWKurrCMq7CznZ5igG5%2FkmlnsWWRo7Fuf5BpZ2aboKp6s7HVopywZ2I%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
