Like in the main series games, Shiny Snorlax is a more saturated blue color. It can be easy to miss to the untrained eye, but luckily it sparkles when it appears, signifying it is a Shiny form. While Shiny hunting in Pokemon Sleep is as simple as waking up every morning, hunting Snorlax is a bit different.</p><p data-injection=true>A different Snorlax appears at each campsite at the start of a new week. Players spend a week, Monday -Sunday, with that Snorlax, powering it up and researching sleep patterns. Every time the player picks a new campsite, there is a chance of the Snorlax being a Shiny one. There is nothing that a player needs to do in order to get this Pokemon – it’s just pure luck.</p><p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">How Does Pokemon Sleep Work?
