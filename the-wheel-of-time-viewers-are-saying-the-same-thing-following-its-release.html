Really digging the story, the world-building and the characters. <strong>Rosamund Pike’s performance is great</strong>. And I’m excited to see where it goes throughout this season," while another added: "The casting is absolutely incredible. It’s impossible for me to pick a favourite casting/character but Padan Fain is definitely up there. Johann Myers is so sinister in his grin alone. I can’t wait to see what @rafejudkins has in store for us!"</p><p id=eHLt6Sy0KChZ data-wc=35>A third person tweeted: "Watched the first two episodes of The Wheel of Time. <strong>Serious high fantasy and diverse cast</strong>. I’m most attracted to the pragmatic caretaker characters Moiraine, Lan, and Nynaeve.
