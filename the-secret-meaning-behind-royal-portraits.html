Beside her were framed photographs of her family, including her father, King George VI; her husband, Prince Philip; son, Prince Charles; his wife, Camilla; and a shot of Prince William with Kate Middleton and their children: Prince George, Princess Charlotte, and Prince Louis.</p><p>While this seemed to be another sweet gesture, some couldn't help but notice that there wasn't a photograph of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle anywhere to be seen. <a href=#>Was this punishment</a> for the pair opting to step back from royal duties? "Last year, the Queen displayed two photos of them — an official wedding portrait and a family picture of them celebrating heir to the throne Prince Charles' 70th birthday. ...&nbsp;She was also accused of removing their photo from her audience room in Buckingham Palace earlier this year," according to <a href=#>Page Six</a>.&nbsp;Granted, there weren't pictures of the <a href=#>queen's other grandchildren</a> either, but the fact is that this may be another example of the royals' tendency to transmit subtle messages each time they pose in front of a camera.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmanBkaYNye9OhnGarlZi%2FpsCMppyappmjtG6uxKGgp5xdp7y6rctmp6iqpKeuqsDSaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
