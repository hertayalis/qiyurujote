The Asylum Wrestling Store recently spoke to Bret Hart when the new ban on leg slapping came up. The Hitman confessed that “enough is enough.” He was tired of seeing leg slapping in “every match” and he was hearing that sound where it didn’t belong as well."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

But come on, enough is enough, in every match. You see guys do stuff and you’re going, ‘That wouldn’t even make a slap sound.’ When you punch somebody in&nbsp;the jaw, it’s not a slap sound. You know, it’s a different kind of sound and you’re making a slap sound for everything. Every single move you do is a slap sound, slap, slap and I totally agree. I’m&nbsp;glad&nbsp;they put their&nbsp;foot&nbsp;down on that but they’re like ten years late. They’ve already kind of in a lot of ways, sadly, ruined wrestling by making it so&nbsp;fake.”</p><p>We’ll have to see how long this ban stays in place. It seems that Drew McIntyre is the only WWE Superstar who can get away with a leg slap at this point, and that’s just during his Claymore Kick. Bret Hart won’t be a bit disappointed if he never sees another misplaced leg slap again.</p><span class=author-name>Felix Upton</span> <span></span><p>Felix Upton is a seasoned writer with over 30 years of experience.
