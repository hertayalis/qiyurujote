Per his "Judge Jerry" <a href=#>bio</a>, Springer studied at Northwestern University, where he gained a degree in law. Subsequently, he worked as a lawyer at times during his professional life.&nbsp;As "Judge Jerry" was debuting in 2019, Springer was asked about what is required to become a judge in a <a href=#>BUILD Series</a> interview. "Well, I'm a lawyer, so you would have to have that," Springer said. He went on to clarify, "In most of the country, you don't even have to be a lawyer necessarily to be a judge — it's an elected office."&nbsp;</p><p>In another interview from 2019, Springer further explained how he dedicated one day toward gaining the proper certification for the title of judge. "There was a day of reviewing how it works. You get special certification, and I'm a lawyer," Springer said, per the <a href=#>New York Post</a>. "You have to be certified [to be a judge]; it's a day thing, and if you're a lawyer it's almost automatic unless you've killed someone." Following this process, Springer was focused on delivering just verdicts on "Judge Jerry."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmampnZYB6fI6wmKxlmpq%2Fs8WMrKeroZ6csrN50Z6YpWWaqrGosY4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
