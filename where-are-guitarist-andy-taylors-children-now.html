He is a devoted husband and father to his wife and his children. He must have a lot of fans that are curious about his kids. We’ll try to find out more about Andy Taylor’s kids in this essay.</p><h2><span id=The_Son_of_Andy_Taylor_Is_Also_A_Musician>The Son of Andy Taylor Is Also A Musician</span></h2><p>The former guitarist for Duran Duran wed Tracey Wilson-Taylor on July 29, 1982. Two years after getting married, on August 20, 1984, the couple gave birth to their first child. The couple’s firstborn, Andrew James Taylor, is their only child.</p><p>Andy J. Taylor, the son of Andy Taylor, shares his father’s passion for music. He is a co-founder and member of the indie band The Electric City. He plays rhythm guitar and sings in the group.</p><p>In addition to being a vocalist, the musician also cooks. Together with Tim Talbot, he established the dine-in and takeout restaurant Le Bun. Le Bun serves food that is influenced by both French and American cuisines and is driven to develop original dual-cuisine dishes. As the Director of Operations and Creative Services at Dicks Hot Chicken & Beer, Andy J. is also employed there.</p><p>We can see that Georgina Taylor, Andy Taylor’s daughter, is the adoring mother of a handsome kid named Albie from her moderate Facebook activity. Unfortunately, there is no information available on the child’s father, Georgie Taylor. She frequently shares photos of her son, expressing how much she adores him.</p><p>Georgina was born on August 11th, and she studied at Oxford, England’s Exeter College. She came from the graduating class of 2006.</p><p>The attractive lady also resides in Ibiza, Spain, at the moment. Her social media sites give the impression that she is a nice, grateful, and thankful person to the people in her life. She routinely uses internet messaging to show her love and affection for her friends and family.</p><p>According to Bethany Taylor’s Instagram account, she is a songwriter and vocalist. Her posts give the impression that she is a friendly person who adores her family. She frequently sends words of gratitude along with photos of her parents.</p><p>Bethany attended Morna Valley School and Morna International College in Spain, and, based on her Facebook profile, she now lives in Ibiza.</p><p>We were unable to find much about the outside of her social media profiles, which is unfortunate. She doesn’t seem to love talking about her job or her professional interests. We look forward to the day when Bethany is more honest about herself.</p><p>The youngest of Tracey and Andy Taylor’s daughters is Isabella Taylor. As an artist, she likes curating and producing. She has a separate Instagram account for her art and design in addition to her one.</p><p>Izzy Taylor was on the production team for the Pili Mili Films and Brew Films movie “Unearthed.” She seems to enjoy hanging out with her friends and having fun on the beach.</p><p>The Andy Taylor children seem to be thriving on their own. The guitarist and his family deserve happiness and success.</p><h2><span id=Children8217s_Name_Meanings_of_Andy_Taylor>Children’s Name Meanings of Andy Taylor</span></h2><p>The Greek name Andreas, which means “manly and strong,” is sometimes spelled as Andrew. Spanish for “farmer,” Georgina is a female given name with English roots.</p><p>The name Bethany is derived from a place name that means “fig house” in Hebrew. The name Isabella, which translates to “God is my oath,” is the Spanish and Italian version of the English name Elizabeth.</p><p>Also Read: <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Taylor Kitsch Doesn’t Have Time To Date Or Wed</a></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Guitarist</a> <a href=# rel=tag>Vocalist</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Bronson Varde</a></h3>Bronson Varde- Biography Bronson Varde is a well-known American vocalist.
