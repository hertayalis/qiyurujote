In fact, at this stage, many of the MCU’s heroes sport entirely CGI costumes, including Tom Holland’s Spider-Man, Don Cheadle’s War Machine and Chadwick Boseman’s Black Panther, while every single one of the Avengers’ nifty time travel suits from Endgame was created on a computer.</p><p data-characters=217 data-current-count=217 data-injectable=false>However, Downey Jr. didn’t have that luxury when he was initially cast as Tony Stark, and an image from the very first time he ever tried on <strong>Iron Man</strong>‘s helmet has resurfaced, which you can check out below.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/rdj-iron-man-helmet.jpg><p data-characters=616 data-current-count=833 data-injectable=false>Robert Downey Jr. would probably have been happy to suffer for his art and have a chunky helmet screwed on over his head during early days in the MCU, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">especially when there were huge question marks at the time</a> over the decision to cast someone who was still in the early stages of a comeback following years of personal problems being handed the lead role in a $150 million comic book blockbuster from an upstart production company making their very first movie. But either way, everything worked out in the end and the actor has now left a lasting mark on the franchise that’ll endure for a long time to come.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e8immKCdXae8o7HRrWSdp6ejsrp5yatkoqqfo3qurc2sZKGdnKKytXnToqSeZaKawLa%2BxZqanqtf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
