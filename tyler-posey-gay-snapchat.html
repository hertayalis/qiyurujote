I am this and this is me. I've never felt more alive... I'm gay!"</p><p>However, as it turned out, Posey was either just kidding... or really happy.</p><p>A rep for the hit MTV show told <a href=#>Fusion </a>that his alleged "coming out" as gay was simply "meant in the context of ‘I’m happy,’ not as a coming out."</p><p>This morning (July 30), the Teen Wolf star cleared the air on Twitter and apologized to those he had offended with the problematic video.</p><p>"Although I'm not gay, I fully support the LGBTQ community. This was a moment intended to reflect that," he wrote. "And everyone, I am truly sorry to the people I've offended or lessened how big coming out is. I just want to spread love in this world."</p><p>Unfortunately for the actor, whether intended or not Posey's tasteless joke — which trivializes the very real experiences of people who have come "out" in the LGBTQ+ community — did not sit well with fans, many of whom took to Twitter to chide Posey for his actions.</p><p><strong>21 Inspiring Stars Who Have (Actually) Come Out</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmion6Wws8HSoWWcp51kwbq4xKtkqaejmsZus8CyZKymkaWwqa3TaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
