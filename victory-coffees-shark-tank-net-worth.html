Courtley said that he wanted to create what he called a Victory Army. “What I’m going to do is I’m gonna recruit, train, equip, and deploy an all-veteran sales force, and this is how we’re going to scale” he explained.</p><p>“Do not underestimate the power of patriotism,” Courtley said during his appearance on the show. “I will survive in the coffee industry the same way I survived in Iraq and Afghanistan. I’ll be better, quicker, and stronger, and I’ll crush the competition.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Courtley, who also wrote the book SEAL Survival Guide: A Navy SEAL’s Secrets to Surviving Any Disaster, later shared with the Denver Business Journal, that he wanted to sell franchises exclusively to fellow veterans. “I would love nothing better than to see a guy I used to work with in Afghanistan roll in with his wheelchair and be able to open his own business. If I am able to create a business model where they are able to come back from being deployed and start a successful profit-earning business, that’s what I want.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-jXcwIi jyCgFD"><p></p></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-gIvpCV jBUmSX">Victory Coffees is still in business.</h2><span id=victory-coffees-is-still-in-business class="sc-lmgQde hEekTv"></span><p>On its website, Victory Coffees touts that it offers monthly deliveries of “award-winning coffee” in whole bean, ground, or K-cup form. “We pride ourselves on being a veteran owned and operated squadron that stands behind our quality and customer service,” the company adds. “Trust us when we say a good cup of coffee was often the best part of our day.”</p><p>Shortly after appearing on 'Shark Tank,' Victory Coffees was estimated to be worth $1 million.
