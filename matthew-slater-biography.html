In his rookie season of 2008, Slater participated in 14 games, earning 12 special teams tackles and returning 11 kickoffs for 155 yards.</p><p>Slater played in 14 games during the 2009 season for the Patriots, making six tackles on special teams and one six-yard sprint as a wide receiver.</p><p>In addition, he averaged 24.5 yards returning 11 kickoffs for 269 yards.

With 17 regular season special teams tackles, Slater led the Patriots and carved up a reputation for himself as a force on special teams.</p><p>But during the season, he was present in all three phases. Slater set up the team for the Patriots’ first score of the season in the season opener against the Miami Dolphins by receiving a 46-yard pass from Tom Brady (his sole career reception).

Despite missing four games early in the season due to injury, he finished with the second-most special teams tackles during the regular season 14 on the club. It was Slater’s on-field exploits that earned him a third consecutive Pro Bowl selection.</p><p>Slater reportedly inked a two-year contract extension on November 26, 2014, meaning he would play for the Patriots through the 2016 campaign.</p><p>Once more, Slater was selected to the Pro Bowl as a special teams player and as an All-Pro. It was his third All-Pro selection and fourth consecutive Pro Bowl selection. In Super Bowl XLIX, Slater received a Super Bowl ring as the Patriots defeated the Seattle Seahawks 28–24.</p><p>In 2015, Slater was again an excellent member of the special teams.

Slater’s father is a seven-time Pro Bowler.</p><p>Slater signed a one-year contract extension with the Patriots through 2017 on August 31, 2016.

He broke Steve Tasker’s record for the most special teams Pro Bowl awards in NFL history by being selected to his eighth Pro Bowl.</p><p>Slater and the Patriots agreed to a two-year contract extension on March 13, 2020. After placekicker Stephen Gostkowski was cut and quarterback Tom Brady left the team, Slater became the Patriots’ longest-serving player.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/media.ghgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/21111137/uknx1howhm65m8j8lz5o.jpg><p>He set an NFL record with nine choices for special teams Pro Bowls when he was named to the 2020 Pro Bowl on December 21, 2020.
