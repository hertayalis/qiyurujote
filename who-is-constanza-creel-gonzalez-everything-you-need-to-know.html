Edith González was in charge of jealously guarding her away from the cameras and screens, so for a long time, her life was a great mystery, including the name of her parent.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110 data-inserter-version=2></span><p>Almost 4 years after she was born, it was revealed that Constanza’s real father was Santiago Creel, a Mexican politician who served as Secretary of the Interior.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-910 data-method=placement-service></span><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Edith Gonzalez Lazo (@edithgonzalezmx1)</a></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111 data-inserter-version=2></span><p>As Constanza grew older, Edith shared more photos of her. And she always described her as a tender, intelligent and loving girl. “She is the love of my life, she loves music and has a huge heart. People tell me that she is a very good girl and what a good job I have done, the bottom line is that she is like that, she was born with those feelings and intelligence.</p><p>Life was wonderful for both of them until Edith began to have severe back pain, even in the company of her daughter, and it was in 2016 that she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. From there, mother and daughter fought to remove the tumor and, after surgeries, it seemed to have won the battle. According to Edith González, Constanza was there for her and was one of her pillars to keep fighting as the battle declined.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112 data-inserter-version=2></span><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Edith Gonzalez Lazo (@edithgonzalezmx1)</a></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-113 data-inserter-version=2></span><p>Meanwhile, the actress went on with her life, traveling, acting, living. And, by her side was Constanza and her husband, Lorenzo Lazo , the love of her life.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-911 data-method=placement-service></span><p>Being the best support of her mother, Constanza came to appear on her mother’s social networks, not as a girl, but as a young girl. They traveled together, went on vacation, and several photos confirmed their beautiful mother-daughter relationship.</p><p>In fact, it was on Instagram, that the great similarity between Edith and Constanza was seen . And, although the young woman shares many features with her father, it was increasingly obvious that, at her age, she looked identical to the actress.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-114 data-inserter-version=2></span><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Edith Gonzalez Lazo (@edithgonzalezmx1)</a></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-115 data-inserter-version=2></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>However, everything reached its climax, when Edith González finally lost the fight against cancer on June 13, 2019. Constanza was about to turn 15 years old, and she did not have her mother to accompany her.</p><p>From that moment on, the young girl returned to the care of her biological father, Santiago Creel, with whom she currently lives, along with her 2 half-sisters. According to her relatives, Constanza greatly suffered the loss of her mother and had to go to a thanatologist to face the painful grief.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-912 data-method=placement-service></span><p>Since then, She has not been seen in the public eye, as was her original custom. However, we hope to see her soon, and she will surely be just like her mother.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-116 data-inserter-version=2></span><p>Did you already know her?</p><h3><a style=color:#555 href=# title="All posts by Amelia Warner" rel=author>Amelia Warner</a></h3><p class=bio-description>Amelia Warner writes all the Latest Articles.
