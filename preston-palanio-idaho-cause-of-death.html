Preston Wayne Palanio you are going to be missed I loved you more than you’ll ever know you had so much personality! I can’t believe you are gone but I’m blessed to have you in my life you’re forever in my heart!&nbsp;&nbsp;Rest easy my sweet boy!”</p><p>“Preston was a couple of years older than Ryker but they crossed paths several times over the years. Ryker chased Preston around the ice those 1st couple of years, as Preston was a gifted little hockey player & skated his heart out.</p><p>Our thoughts & prayers are with the Palacio family. Preston had a contagious smile & he will be missed by all! #sticksoutforpreston here at a spring hockey tournament in Vancouver, BC.”</p><p><strong>Read more :</strong></p><ul><li><a href=#>The Truth Behind Jimi Hendrix’s Death, How Did Jimi Hendrix Die?</a></li><li><a href=#>Youtuber Savannah Labrant Reports The 29-year-old Death Of Her Daughter’s Father</a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwtr7RnqWtZZ%2Bjuaq6xGeaqKVfnrmtusSsqmaZnpl6qbHApauhZ6CnsrTAzqdkqZmclruqu4yim5qgn2KwosHSnmSonl2ZsqLAx2hqaW5obnw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
