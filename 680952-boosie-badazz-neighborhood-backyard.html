One user writes, "Finally someone doing something interesting and profitable with their money." Another adds, "That’s what’s up! I’m doing the same thing here in Detroit. We need more of this." Not everyone is a fan of Boosie's big plans, however, with one commenter claiming, "This is <a href=# rel>one of the worst ideas</a> since the 'big ass chain' but at least this should have some resale value assuming it ever gets finished."</p><p><strong>Read More: <a href=# rel>Boosie Spoils His Daughter On Her 16th Birthday</a></strong></p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-boosie-invests-in-his-family>Boosie Invests In His Family</h2></span><p>In other Boosie news, the rapper recently <a href=# rel>shared his feelings on Twitter</a> about the highly-anticipated <a href=# rel>Devin Haney vs. Vasiliy Lomachenko</a> boxing match.
