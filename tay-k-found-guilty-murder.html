The 19-year-old rapper, born Taymor McIntyre, received a 30-year sentence for one count of aggravated robbery and 13-year sentences&nbsp;on two separate charges of aggravated robbery, all of which will run concurrently.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">The conviction relates to a deadly 2016 robbery when Tay-K was 16 that resulted in the death of Ethan Walker, who was 21. Witness testimony stated that&nbsp;Tay-K entered&nbsp;Walker's house in Mansfield, Texas&nbsp;with six others with the intention of stealing drugs and money, but the victim didn't have the items they were searching for. Walker's girlfriend&nbsp;testified that the victim&nbsp;was shot with his hands in the air.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">According to the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Fort Worth Star Telegraph</a>, Tay-K's lawyers argued that&nbsp;the rapper “only participated in the robbery, was not armed, and had no idea that people would be shot." Latharian Merritt, the man accused of shooting Walker, was&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">sentenced to life in prison</a>&nbsp;last year. All involved were either found guilty or reached plea deals, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">CNN affiliate KTVT</a>.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">Tay-K rose to prominence after&nbsp;being placed under house arrest following the incident. His track&nbsp;“The Race”&nbsp;was recorded in 2017 after he removed his ankle bracelet and absconded. The song peaked at No. 44 on the Billboard Hot 100 and&nbsp;was used as evidence against the rapper during the trial.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">The Fader</a>, prosecutors referenced the song's video, saying, "It’s in the lyrics. There’s no better insight into this man’s character than that video." The victim's father&nbsp;Richard Walker said Tay-K was "the person who profited off of this and saw this as a career move."</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">He continued, “Every lyric to 'The Race' is stained with my son’s blood. Every ‘free Tay-K’ T-shirt that was ever sold has my son’s blood on it.”</p><p>Your Highsnobiety privacy settings have blocked this YouTube video.</p>Enable All Media<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbXGoaqnp5KesrXFjZympmegZMGixYykZJ%2BnpaOxbrPUoqOtsV2iwrOwxKtm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
