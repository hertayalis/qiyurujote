Additionally, the Jordan 2 Low will also be getting some new color schemes. This is definitely good news for all consumers as they will be able to choose between high-tops and low-tops. This can always be a hard decision to make, but now, Jumpman will be making it that much easier. Moreover, some new teasers are hitting the internet. The latest one comes from both @zsneakerheadz and sneakerfiles.com.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-another-air-jordan-2-low>Another Air Jordan 2 Low</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">As you can see from the photoshop rendering above, this is for the "Black-Fire Red" colorway. Overall, this is yet another shoe that plays into the Chicago Bulls aesthetic. This is an aesthetic that fans have always enjoyed and that is not going to change, anytime soon. Firstly, this sneaker opens up with a black upper. Secondly, the shoe then evolves into some red on the outlines throughout the upper. Moreover, we get some grey and then red on the outsole. When you put it all together, you get a shoe that is definitely going to turn some heads.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">For now, it is believed that this shoe will drop during the Holiday season between October and December. However, there is no concrete release date right now. Having said that, you can stay tuned to HNHH for all of the latest news and updates from around the sneaker world.
