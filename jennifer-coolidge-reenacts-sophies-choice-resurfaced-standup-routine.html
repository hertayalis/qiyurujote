In the two minute-long clip, tweeted on Monday by Netflix’s Jarett Wieselman, Coolidge tells the audience that the very first job she landed when she got to Hollywood was a bit part in the 1982 Holocaust drama, Sophie’s Choice.</p><p data-characters=335 data-current-count=335 data-injectable=false>In the film, Meryl Streep plays an Auschwitz survivor who was forced by the Nazis to decide which one of her two children would be sent to the gas chamber. It’s not exactly the type of fare you’d expect to see in a comedy routine, but as Coolidge explains, her role was that of a German girl who worked in the strudel shop.</p><p data-characters=481 data-current-count=816 data-injectable=true>“This was the scene where the gestapo is looking for Sophie, and I’m behind the counter,” she recalled, telling the crowd that she would reenact the scene. With that, Coolidge pulled a large danish out of her small clutch purse, and proceeded to take large bites onstage. “Oh hey, how ya doin?” she said with a heavy German accent, between mouthfuls. “If you’re looking for Sophie she’s hiding in the corner over there. Mmhmm!”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>For anyone else who has never seen this 2010 video of Jennifer Coolidge doing stand-up at Comix in NYC, do yourself a favor and watch it now <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/Lm7BCPhJjc</a></p>— Jarett Wieselman (@JarettSays) <a href=#>December 26, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=167 data-current-count=467 data-injectable=true>“Thank you for laughing at that bit, because the only reason I put it in the show was so I could have a pastry break at this time,” Coolidge then quipped.</p><p data-characters=357 data-current-count=357 data-injectable=false>What makes the joke even funnier, however, is that Coolidge obviously never appeared in Sophie’s Choice. In fact, her first onscreen credit didn’t occur until 11 years later when she was cast in the season 5 episode of Seinfeld, “The Masseuse,” in which she played Jerry’s masseuse girlfriend who refused to give him a massage.</p><p data-characters=198 data-current-count=555 data-injectable=false>But had Coolidge, then-21, appeared in Sophie’s Choice as a danish-munching German counter girl, we have no choice but to assume that she would have crushed it — as she does everything else.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S3prrNop2eql2YvLC4yJ2enmWimrKvrcKtqmarn6W1qrHSZpqhp5mYsm6%2BxKysq56RmLKledKtmKecpaV6s7vUraCnnV8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
