Daniels’ script has simply collected these ideas to create a feature-length adaptation of someone we know from the modern TV show that is a social media feed. He plays to expected beats, while thinking that by simply basing a story on a Karen that the outraged entertainment will write itself.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=#>Taryn Manning</a> stars as the titular monster, and from the beginning it’s all about micro aggressions and nagging requests meant to control and dehumanize Malik and Imani. She pushes boundaries of what a good neighbor does, she disrespects them with a smile, she sexually objectifies Malik,&nbsp;she tries to make Imani feel alien about her name.&nbsp;It’s telling that not even the role is amusing to watch as the grotesque clown show that you think it’s going to be with every awkward interaction, or any time you get to look real hard at Manning's jet black hair perched atop her tiny frame. Her performance itself is an empty provocation, and like the rest of the movie would have fared better if her director dared to go over-the-top and let any gaudy ideas take over the literal ones. She’s many noticeable levels lower than the character could be to still make its point, for all of her fury, entitlement, and overflowing whiteness, and Manning simply plays it so that we recognize her impression.&nbsp;</p><p>There's nothing surprising about this movie, and maybe Daniels thinks that’s the point, and a clever one. Yes, of course she’s friends with cops, who help racially profile and beat up on Malik, among others; of course she’s going to say something offensive to Black people&nbsp;and then gaslight them for being offended; of course she actually hates the neighbors that she speaks to in paper-thin niceties. “Karen” doesn’t even have to preach to the choir about this stuff, because this is all just part of the character. She's as racist as Batman is rich, and Daniels gets no points for what little associations he makes.&nbsp;<span class=Apple-converted-space></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46kmKudnmK6sMLInmSrnaaesrh5kWlpag%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
