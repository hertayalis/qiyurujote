They are naturally regal, and always assume boss-like roles.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/03/72ef5c5d-3ff7-4c08-83a5-c9bc832d4e5e.jpg><h2>What does her Sun sign mean?</h2><p>There’s an unmistakably regal air to Solar Leos.</p><p>These are dignified--even noble--folk. Leos have a reputation for being conceited but think again. Leos do feel important, but this generally takes the form of wanting to change the world in some way--to make the world a better place.</p><p>They are generally motivated by affection for people, and often have big dreams and plans to make people happy.</p><p>Generally, Leos are hard-working. After all, they are attracted to the good things in life, and they know they have to work to get them. It is sometimes difficult to imagine Leos as go-getters if you happen to catch them in one of their languid moods.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/03/NINTCHDBPICT000595565507.jpg><p>These people can sleep in, laze around, and luxuriate for long periods of time.</p><p>However, when they do get to work, they do it with intensity and determination. In this way, they are not unlike their symbol, the lion.</p><p>The worst thing you can do to a Leo is accuse them of bad intentions. Displaying behavior that makes them think you don’t appreciate them runs a close second.</p><p>These happy, jovial people become mighty hurt when others don’t see them for their noble intentions.</p><h2>What is her full Birth Chart breakdown?</h2><ul><li><strong>Sun</strong>&nbsp;- Leo ♌</li><li><strong>Moon</strong>&nbsp;- Taurus ♉</li><li><strong>Mercury</strong>&nbsp;- Leo ♌</li><li><strong>Venus</strong>&nbsp;- Virgo ♍&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Mars</strong>&nbsp;- Gemini ♊</li><li><strong>Jupiter</strong>&nbsp;- Virgo ♍&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Saturn</strong>&nbsp;- Aquarius ♒︎</li><li><strong>Uranus</strong>&nbsp;- Capricorn ♑︎</li><li><strong>Neptune</strong>&nbsp;- Capricorn ♑︎</li><li><strong>Pluto</strong>&nbsp;- Scorpio ♏︎</li><li><strong>Lilith</strong>&nbsp;- Aquarius ♒︎</li><li><strong>N Node</strong>&nbsp;- Sagittarius ♐︎</li></ul><h2>What does her Moon sign mean?</h2><p>Familiarity is important to Lunar Taureans. These people are earthy and strong-willed. They feel with their senses and they are pretty much rooted in their ways.</p><p>They revel in material comforts--in fact, building a solid and comfortable home and foundation helps to keep them feeling safe and content.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/03/NINTCHDBPICT000592895708.jpg><p>It isn’t wise to try to push Lunar Taureans into doing anything, but once they have made a commitment, they’re persevering. There’s a steadiness to this position of the Moon that is comforting to those close to them.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>But the conservative streak in these natives can be maddening to more progressive personalities. They tend to go out of their way to avoid “messy” or unpredictable situations, crises, and emotional displays.</p><p>Instead, they focus on creating a reliable and secure life around them. In relationships, Lunar Taureans may not easily recognize their partner’s need for change, growth, or emotional stimulation.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hqZWaEdYCVaJuepZliubDCwK2mZpqZp8GpsMCyZKyskad6tLXGp2SboaKptW6vx5qprWc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
