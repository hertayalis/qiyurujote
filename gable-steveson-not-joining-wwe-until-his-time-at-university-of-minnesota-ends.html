However, he did reveal that there’s a catch to it. The 23-year old can’t start at WWE until his college is done.</p><p>The contract’s terms make sense. Even though Steveson is a natural talent, he would definitely need substantial training in order to learn the ropes of the pro-wrestling world. When he was asked about whether WWE wanted him to skip on college, he revealed:</p><p>That never came up. I told them that I wanted to go back and finish school. Their number one priority was, ‘you can do that.’ Vince, Nick Khan, and Triple H all said, ‘Go win the National Title. Everything will still be in place for you. Get your degree and we’ll see you after that.’ Part of my deal is I can go on stage during my school time.</p><p>The wrestler was then asked about whether he expects a main roster debut or an NXT run first. While he said that he thinks that he’ll be headed to the main roster, he’s open to anything.</p><p>There’s a very good chance that I go straight to the main roster and not go to NXT. I’m open for anything. With the way things are going, I think I’m going to jump straight to the main roster. I know there’s a lot to learn and I’m ready to soak everything in like a sponge and be ready to go out there and put on a good show for the crowd.</p><p>Steveson is a while away from his WWE debut, but there are talks of a<a href=#> Brock Lesnar Vs. Gable Steveson match</a>. It was previously reported that <a href=#>Steveson might skip NXT for the main roster</a>. Ahead of his WWE signing, Steveson proclaimed himself to be <a href=#>the next Kurt Angle</a>.</p><p><strong>What’s your take on this story?
