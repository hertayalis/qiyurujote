Since the temperatures have been rising fast and furious in Arizona, I have been using the grill almost every day. For many years, I had “fear of the grill.” My husband was always the “griller” and I let him do his thing. I took care of everything else and he was the ultimate meat guy."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

To create a juicy burger, it is best to use 80/20 ground chuck.</li><li><strong>Season the meat.</strong> This is a key step as the salt will bring out the natural flavors of the meat. Salt on both sides just before putting on the grill to get a nice crust on the outside.</li><li><strong>Make a thumbprint in the center of the patty.</strong> This helps to keep the burger from puffing up in the center.&nbsp; It helps to keep the burger in shape. Make the burger patties wider than the bun because the meat shrinks as it cooks.</li><li><strong>Heat the grill on high heat to create a nice sear on the burger.</strong> For medium burgers, cook approximately for 4 minutes per side. For medium-well burgers, cook for 4 1/2 minutes per side. The USDA recommends cooking ground beef until it reaches an internal temperature of 160˚F for safety reasons.</li><li><strong>With about 1 minute left of cooking time, place cheese on top of the burger to allow it to melt</strong>.</li><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Brie-Burger-with-Caramelized-Onions-and-Sundried-Tomatoes-3.jpg alt="Brie Burger with Caramelized Onions and Sundried Tomatoes The Ultimate Burger with melted Brie Cheese, Sundried Tomatoes, Queen Creek Olive Mill Caramelized Red Onion Fig Tapenade, and Arugula.
