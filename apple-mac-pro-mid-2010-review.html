With the exception of the Mac mini, every single Apple desktop uses an Intel CPU, an Intel chipset and an AMD GPU. To be fair though, Apple has alternated between NVIDIA and AMD for graphics every year for the past four years.</p><p>The GPU of choice in the Mac Pro is the Radeon HD 5770 equipped with 1GB of GDDR5. Clocked and spec'd identically to the PC version, this is the graphics card you get in all three standard models. For an extra $200 you can get a Radeon HD 5870 with 1GB of GDDR5, and for an extra $250 you can have two 5770s instead of one. Don't get too excited, the multi-GPU route is explicitly for more displays there's no concept of CrossFire under OS X at this point.</p><p align=center><a href=#><img border=0 height=359 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/reviews/mac/MacPro2010/_DSC2955_sm.jpg width=600 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>The Radeon HD 5770 is a huge step up from the GeForce GT 120 that previously came standard in the Mac Pro. The performance difference between the two is staggering! Where the 5770 does disappoint however is in comparison to EVGA's GeForce GTX 285 Mac Edition. It's slower.</p><p>I used Half Life 2 Episode 2 under OS X to get a general idea of gaming GPU performance. The improvement is huge compared to the old GeForce GT 120 that shipped in last year’s Mac Pro. Ultra high resolution frame rates improved by over 5x, while even 19x12 performance tripled.</p><p align=center><img alt="Half Life 2 Episode 2 OS X - 1024 x 768 - 0X AA/0X AF" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph3969/33126.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p align=center><img alt="Half Life 2 Episode 2 OS X - 1920 x 1200 - 0X AA/16X AF" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph3969/33125.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p align=center><img alt="Half Life 2 Episode 2 OS X - 2560 x 1600 - 4X AA/16X AF" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph3969/33124.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>If you’re curious about Starcraft 2 performance of the Radeon HD 5770 at 2560 x 1600, ultra quality settings, I saw an average frame rate of ~21 fps with a minimum at 17 fps and maximum at 27 fps. Note that this is in our CPU intensive battle test, so peak frame rates will be higher but if you’re doing a lot of unit management that’s pretty much what you can expect. In other words it’s not fast enough to play on a 30” at full resolution without feeling a bit choppy at times. To average above 30 fps you have to drop resolution and quality settings.</p><h3>Display Outputs and Frame Buffer</h3><p>The 5770 has three outputs in the form of two mini-DP and one dual-link DVI. The mini-DP ports can each drive a 27-inch LED Cinema Display while the DL-DVI port can drive a 30. This is a Radeon HD 5000 series card so you can actually have all three outputs active at the same time. That's right, with a single card you can drive three monitors. And with two, six monitors.</p><p align=center><a href=#><img border=0 height=377 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/reviews/mac/MacPro2010/_DSC2961_sm.jpg width=600 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>While 1GB of memory is enough to drive a single high resolution panel, it can be a stretch for two or three depending on what you're doing. As I've pointed out in the past you can have around 130 open Safari windows before you'll max out a video card with a 1GB frame buffer at 2560 x 1600. However, fire up Photoshop and open twenty 12MP images and you'll get the same effect. For heavy imaging work you'll still want more than one 5770 if you are going to drive multiple high resolution (2560 pixels wide) displays.</p><p>What would've been better is for Apple to offer a 2GB card, at least as an option, for very high end multi-monitor users.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZIB6gphomKmonJp6rq3CZqerp12itqV5kWloaWWimsOqsdZoaw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
