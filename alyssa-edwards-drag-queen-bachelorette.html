Alyssa boasts 1.4 million followers <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">on Instagram</a> and has partnerships with brands like Smirnoff and TAZO.&nbsp;</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Esquire</a>, the entertainer credited her gay uncle for recognizing her talent from an early age.

We need to get him involved in dance, because he picks up this stuff really quickly,'" Alyssa recalled.</p><p>"I would stay after and watch the other classes, and I would kind of do the choreography on the side.
