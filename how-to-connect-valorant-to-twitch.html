Since the Valorant's release in June 2020, the game has gained a fair amount of notoriety for both its tight team-versus-team gameplay, recognizable characters, and striking art style, fostering a sizable streaming audience and community.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitch</span></figure><p>Part of that success with both streamers and stream viewers is Riot's Twitch drops. Streamers who have Valorant Riot Drops enabled provide their audience with the opportunity to pick up unique loot, skins, and cosmetics for Valorant just by watching the game on Twitch. The only thing standing between viewers and rare Valorant drops is connecting their Riot account to Twitch.tv. No Twitch Prime account is required, so the chance to win unique <a href=#>in-game drops</a> is open to everyone.
