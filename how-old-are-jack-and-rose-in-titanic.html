We can easily ascertain that the more buoyant of the film’s protagonists was a scant 17 years of age during the events of the movie – the researchers say as much when they’re calling her a liar in the setup for the story. Old Lady Rose, played by the late Gloria Stuart, was just shy of 101 years old in 1996, putting her date of birth somewhere in 1895, and making her just shy of old enough to gamble when <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">her sweet ride sank to the depths</a> in 1912. Meanwhile, Winslet shot the part when she was 21 and 22 years old.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=422 data-current-count=422 data-injectable=true>Then there’s Jack Dawson, the hoodlum and nogoodnik who helped stink up a perfectly nice stranger’s car in the bowels of the RMS Titanic’s cargo hold. Jack’s age is less specific. The film’s script lists Jack as “about 20,” and that’s the last official word on the subject. Jack never states outright when he was born, but even if he had, he’s not the kind of guy that you can trust with dates and times.</p><p data-characters=400 data-current-count=400 data-injectable=false>He specifically states that he ice fished with his father on Lake Wissota, a reservoir created during the construction of the Wissota Hydroelectric Dam, which didn’t exist until five years after the Titanic sank. That either makes him a liar, or <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a time traveler</a> who singled out the doomed ship as a great place to meet women who he’d never have to call again. Either way, he got what he deserved.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJon6ivXaS5pXnAq5xmopGYuG6tzZ1kq6ejmnqquoytoK2Znp6wcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
