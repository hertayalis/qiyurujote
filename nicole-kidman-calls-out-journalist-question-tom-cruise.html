Speaking with the The Guardian about Amazon Studios's Being the Ricardos, a dramatic biopic in which she stars as the late comedy icon Lucille Ball, Kidman called out the reporter for drawing a parallel between the movie's central relationship and her in-real-life marriage with Cruise.
Being the Ricardos explores the fraught romance between Ball and husband Desi Arnaz (played by Javier Bardem), the I Love Lucy sweethearts who ultimately separated in 1960."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

But from it come some extraordinary things. And I love that. I love that it’s not a happy ending,” Kidman told the outlet. “This film says you can make an extraordinary relationship thrive and leave remnants of it that exist forever. Yeah, that’s really gorgeous. You can’t make people behave how you want them to, and sometimes you’re going to fall in love with someone who isn’t going to be the person you spend the rest of your life with. And I think that’s all very relatable. You may have kids with them. You may not, but they were very much in love.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In response, interviewer Eva Wiseman gently asked if this was Kidman's "way of talking about Tom Cruise."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Oh, my God, no, no. Absolutely not. No. I mean, that’s, honestly, so long ago that that isn’t in this equation. So no,” Kidman replied. “And I would ask not to be pigeonholed that way, either. It feels to me almost sexist, because I’m not sure anyone would say that to a man. And at some point, you go, ‘Give me my life. In its own right.’”</p><img alt="united states april 25 tom cruise and nicole kidman in los angeles 1992 photo by vinnie zuffantegetty images" title="Tom Cruise Archive" width=2437 height=1625 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-114742817-1640897588.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Vinnie Zuffante</span><span class="css-bf2l0q e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman pose for a photo together in 1992.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Cruise and Kidman married in 1990 after meeting on the set of Days of Thunder.
