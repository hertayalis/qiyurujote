The photo shows Morrone, decked out in a gorgeous polka-dot dress, frozen in a pose with her arms ethereally extended, her foot pointed like a ballerina, her head tilted toward the sky, and her hair a brunette cascade—and DiCaprio, in his snapback and white hoodie, taking photos of her on his phone.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">One Twitter user <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://twitter.com/andrewgrutt/status/1130246132246827008?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1130246132246827008&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.harpersbazaar.com%2Fcelebrity%2Flatest%2Fa29474112%2Fcamila-morrone-leonardi-dicaprio-interview%2F" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=observed class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">observed</a>, "Leonardo DiCaprio now knows: You either die a hero or live long enough to become an Instagram boyfriend."</p><img alt="** PREMIUM EXCLUSIVE RATES APPLY ** Leonardo Dicaprio turns photographer to take pictures of stunning girlfriend Camila Morrone" title="** PREMIUM EXCLUSIVE RATES APPLY ** Leonardo Dicaprio turns photographer to take pictures of stunning girlfriend Camila Morrone" width=1000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-leonardo-dicaprio-camila-morrone-mega-1571159013.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">DFGRI - MEGA</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I saw the meme," the actress told Vanity Fair. "Poor thing, he's being called an Instagram boyfriend. He's an environmentalist and a movie star and it doesn't mean a thing!"</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Morrone also opened up about a controversial Instagram post she made, in which she posted photos of Hollywood couple Lauren Bacall and Humphrey Bogart, who had a 25-year age gap (Morrone and DiCaprio have a 22-year age gap). Morrone captioned the photos of the Hollywood couple with, "A love like this."<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Some, who view Morrone and DiCaprio's age difference in an unfavorable light, took this as on opportunity to flame the actress. "A 'bullshit' like this," one user commented. "Really??" another wrote.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Morrone told the magazine, "I've been starting to show my sense of humor more. People will always have awful things to say because there's a sense of entitlement and safety behind the screen, but trust me, you don't need to be that angry."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">DiCaprio and Morrone were first romantically linked together in December 2017, after <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/movies/leonardo-dicaprio-spotted-leaving-private-jet-with-20-year-old-model-camila-morrone/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=People class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">People</a> reported that the Titanic actor was spotted leaving her house.
