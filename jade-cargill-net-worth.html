So I was walking out the door as Brandon was walking in, like a rom-com or something. And I guess he noticed me and asked about me. Like, 'Who was that?'"</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"It took four months for me to actually say, 'Alright, fine.' I’m not big on athletes! Lol. Being an athlete myself, I just know the operation," Jade wrote. "Plus, I was living in France at the time to model. But he was trying, trying, trying. And eventually, I was like, 'Alright. Give him my number. Let’s see where this goes.'"</p><p>Jade described their dynamic as "sweet," later referring to Brandon as a "goofy, fun-loving man. ... I’m very similar, so we just mesh. He’s the person that calms me down, I guess you could say.
