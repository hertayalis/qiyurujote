Best of all, you don’t have to endure a checkpoint at the airport to get to any of these places from Atlanta. Just hop in the car in the morning and you can catch the last few lifts up the mountain by the end of the day.</p><p class=story-text data-index=2>If you’ve never skied east of the Mississippi, don’t be alarmed by those noisy things that look and sound like monster oscillating fans spewing white powder from the sides of the slopes. They are making artificial snow when the natural snow doesn’t show. It’s common around these parts and those snow-making machines can actually churn out some good powder when the temps fall a few degrees below freezing.</p><p class=story-text data-index=5>The lower elevations make for shorter ski seasons and less snow, it’s true, but the lift tickets are cheaper and the runs closer to home. So head north on the highway this season and you’ll find that the spirit of winter is just as alive in the Appalachians as it is in the Rockies.</p><p class=story-text data-index=6><b>1. Cataloochee Ski Area, N.C.</b></p><p class=story-text data-index=7>One of the first ski resorts to open in the Appalachian mountains, Cataloochee in Maggie Valley has been a local favorite for generations.

Ober Gatlinburg, Tenn.</b></p><p class=story-text data-index=14>This is the only ski resort in Tennessee and one of the closest to Atlanta.
